          <p>
            Hello! My name is <strong>Edielyn G. Nase</strong>, a dedicated and passionate .
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied at <strong>Bulacan State University </strong>, where I earned my degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. My journey has been enriched by my love for technology and my commitment to continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am goal-oriented, eager to learn, and value both creative and technical challenges. Beyond academics, I enjoy simple moments â€” especially enjoying chicken with someone special or celebrating Christmas, my favorite holiday, as a symbol of hope and survival.
