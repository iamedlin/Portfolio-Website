        <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is <strong>Edielyn G. Nase</strong>, a dedicated and passionate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at <strong>Bulacan State University â€“ Main Campus</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong interest in technology, particularly in areas such as web development, embedded systems, and AI-driven applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am goal-oriented, eager to learn, and value both creative and technical challenges. Beyond academics, I enjoy simple moments â€” especially enjoying chicken with someone special or celebrating Christmas, my favorite holiday, as a symbol of hope and survival.
        </p>
